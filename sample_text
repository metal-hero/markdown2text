# Dillinge\n---\n\n[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)\n
\nDillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.\n
\n  - Type some Markdown on the left\n  - See HTML in the right\n  - Magic\n
\nYou can also:\n  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive\n  - Drag and drop files into Dillinger
\n  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF\n
\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]\n
\n> The overriding design goal for Markdown\'s
\n>> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
\n>> as possible. The idea is that a
\n> Markdown-formatted document should be\n> publishable as-is, as plain text, without\n> looking like it\'s been marked up with tags
\n> or formatting instructions.\n\nThis text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown\'s syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.\n
\n### Tech\n\nDillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:\n\n* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
\n* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor\n* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
\n* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps\n* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
\n* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]\n* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
\n* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]\n* [jQuery] - duh\n
\nAnd of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]\n on GitHub.\n\n### Installation\n
\nDillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.\n\nDownload and extract the [latest pre-built release](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/releases).\n\
nInstall the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.\n\n```sh\n$ cd dillinger\n$ npm install -d\n$ node app\n```\n
\nFor production environments...\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --production\n$ npm run predeploy\n$ NODE_ENV=production node app\n```\n
\n### Plugins\n\nDillinger is currently extended with the following plugins\n\n* Dropbox\n* Github\n* Google Drive\n* OneDrive\n
\nReadmes, how to use them in your own application can be found here:\n\n* [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb]\n* [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh]
\n* [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd]\n* [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd]\n\n### Development\n\nWant to contribute? Great!\n
\nDillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.\nMake a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!\n
\nOpen your favorite Terminal and run these commands.\n\nFirst Tab:\n```sh\n$ node app\n```\n\nSecond Tab:\n```sh\n$ gulp watch\n```\n
\n(optional) Third:\n```sh\n$ karma start\n```\n#### Building for source\nFor production release:\n```sh\n$ gulp build --prod\n```
\nGenerating pre-built zip archives for distribution:\n```sh\n$ gulp build dist --prod\n```\n### Docker
\nDillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.\n
\nBy default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.\n
\n```sh\ncd dillinger\nnpm run-script build-docker\n```
\nThis will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Moreover, this uses a _hack_ to get a more optimized `npm` build by copying the dependencies over and only installing when the `package.json` itself has changed.  Look inside the `package.json` and the `Dockerfile` for more details on how this works.\n
\nOnce done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 80 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):\n
\n```sh\ndocker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:latest\n```\n
\nVerify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.\n\n```sh\n127.0.0.1:8000\n```\n
\n#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud\n\nSee [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md)\n\n
\n#### docker-compose.yml\n\nChange the path for the nginx conf mounting path to your full path, not mine!\n\n### N|Solid and NGINX\n
\nMore details coming soon.\n\n\n### Todos\n\n - Write Tests\n - Rethink Github Save\n - Add Code Comments\n - Add Night Mode\n
